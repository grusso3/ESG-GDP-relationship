## A- Motivation & Overview

Motivated by Ray Dalio's new book: "The Changing World Order" where he discusses rise and fall of empires through time; we saw major highlights, graphically represented using charts, showing multiple social, governmental and economic indicators portrayed together and indicating a sort of correlation between them on a global macro scale for different major countries. In his book Ray Dalio shows a graph where GDP, competitiveness, Education, Innovation & Technology, Trade, Military and some other factors correlate together and rise and fall as if there is a direct relationship between them; which was showcased for countries like USA,Netherlands and other. He calls them the major drivers of power of a country.The book can be found through the following link:

One of the charts portrayed in the book:

```

We adopted this thinking and are trying to use in a more socio-economic context to
study potential links in these contrasted indicators.


## B- Related Work

Multiple studies and research have been conducted before, linking
socio-economic indexes but were mostly focused on specific countries and more so
specific financial and economic indicators tied to a few major social indicators.
We came across many readings linking specific indicators such as ESG score, or 
health for specific age group in a specific region which were compared to 
macro-economic indexes such as GDP or unemployment, but we did not see research
as wide as our study that takes into account multiple factors across many 
countries and regions.

Some related work found resembling our analysis:

- *"The Impact of Environmental, Social and Governance Practices (ESG) on Economic Performance: Evidence from ESG Score" - International Journal of Trade Economics and Finance*

- *"Economic Growth and Social Indicators: An Exploratory Analysis" - The University of Chicago*


## C- Research Questions

Our Goal:

We are attempting to check whether improvements in  SOcial, Environmental and Governmental aspects of a country impact or correlate with Economic improvement of the country itself. Moreover we would also be checking if there is a relationship withing the ESG indicators themselves and if countries with similar categorical aspects have a correlation within them for the above mentioned indicators.

Our research attempts to answer the following interrogations:

1. **Are Social, environmental and governmental indexes correlated?**
2. **Are these above links correlated/linked to Economic indicators?**
3. **Are there differences in relationships between different countries? Does Income Level affect the socio-economic relationships? Does a country's Region affect the socio-economic relationships ?** 
4. **Are traditional social indicators related with to ESG indexes or with Economic Indicators?**

We will be basing or research & analysis on countries with existing data and conducting quantitative and visual studies on a selected group of countries to try and derive the conclusions to our research questions.
