## A- The Bottom Line

###  Macro-View

- Environmental , Social and Governmental indicators do in fact correlate with Economic growth.
- Correlation among the the scoring Indexes is also visible 
- Traditional Social indicators used showed weaker relationships compared to Score Indexes

### Take-Away Conclusions

- Higher Income Level Countries show consistently better ESG scores over time
- Higher Income countries with High scores correlate less with traditional social indicators
- Region has an effect only if it is wealthy itself compared to the rest of the world
- Economic Freedom is not a major driver of GDP growth nor is it really linked to Human Development and Environmental Performance
- Environmental Perfromance However correlated well with GDP per capita and Human Development


*Moral of the Story: As a country, if you're wealthy and you have a big economy, it is more likely you will have a relatively better Environmental Performance, Human Development and Economic Freedom Score over time..... Not surprising at all we know!!!*

## B- Research Limitations

### Time Frame and Periodicity 

- Choice of 30 years data (and for ESG studies 25 years) with annual periodicity might not be sufficient to conduct quantitative assessments, although this was the only available common data found.
- Quantitative analysis might also benefit from quarterly or monthly data use but we were also limited with periodicity for ESG indictors

### Choice of Inidcators

- We chose GDP per Capita as our main Economic indicator; after testing for FDI net inflows and FDI % of GDP. Some could use Annual GDP values or even FDI gross inward flows.
- our Scoring Indexes are models based on underlying socio-economic, natural resource, environmental and governmental variables. the score indexes range between 0 and 100 and might affect some quantitative and visual analysis
- Non traditional social indicators used were just 4 categories and might not be conclusive enough to deduce a weak relationship with Economic indicators
- The EFI is taken as proxy for governmental indicator that includes factors such as government tax burden, ease of business , government spending and judicial aspects and some other economic variables which might not make it the utmost best governmental indicator

### Models and Adjustments

- The EPI index we remodeled through excel takes out Fisheries factor from the study in order to include more countries and this might affect EPI score if it were to be evaluated as the data source describes it
- **ESG Composite** we created distributes weights almost equally among Education , life Expectancy, Income, Environment and Economic Freedom Index which is used as the main ESG proxy to compare to traditional social indicators and GDP
- Some minor linear interpolation done on missing data of big significant countries
- Rebasing was done through using the same values for EPI, EFI and ESGcomp from 1990 till 1995

### Representative Sample Countries

We chose a sample of 20 countries from all over the world and from different income groups to derive conclusions on the relationships in our time series analysis. We also used a smaller sample to conduct quantitative analysis. It is logical to use the sample as an indication of the relationships studies but it is not completely statistically conclusive as other countries might show very different results.
We also filtered around 100 countries out, to be able to keep countries that had data in common between all indicators

## C- Future Work

A lot of further quantitative and visual analysis can be made on this topic.
Since our data set is quite wide and takes into consideration many countries across the world a more accurate analysis can be derives from studying either a specific country or region, or studying a specific indicator against another.
